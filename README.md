--- How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and  adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from  Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the  database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this  way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

I focused on clean code and modularity. I organize the code to perform each CRUDE operation into distinct functions to perform single operations. This separation was more accessible for debugging and brought modularity to implement new features in the future or use the python module for different applications where CRUD is essential.

--- How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how  you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso  Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from  previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies  would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client  requests?

When approaching problems, I break down stakeholder requests and compile a checklist to make sure all needed requirements are included and implemented. I initially focused on the database design and filtering of data required, such as age and breed. Then, I connected database operations to the dashboard. This has been different from my previous assignments using a UI or dashboard to connect my code and data. In the future, I would apply a breakdown technique to ensure all client specifications are met.

--- What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would  your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists are problem solvers to the core who design and develop systems that solve complex issues. Working on this project is a great example of problem-solving, using a database that categorizes dogs for search and rescue training. I've contributed to solving a problem that allows Grazioso to search through data faster.
